Build a modern, visually stunning, responsive website for a gourmet pizzeria called Donatello. The design should evoke an artisan, craft-based vibe, celebrating the tradition of handmade pizza. The site should feature micro animations, rich colors inspired by cheese, tomatoes, and garlic (think: creamy yellows, rich reds, and rustic whites), and a warm, inviting yet modern aesthetic.

Requirements:
Logo Placeholder:

A round logo container placed in the header that allows for uploading or embedding an image later.

It should be central or top-left, slightly elevated with soft shadows.

Tagline:

Prominently display:
“We believe in the craft.”
Use an elegant serif font for a traditional touch.

Hero Section (Top of Page):

Embed a full-width autoplay video background that starts immediately when the user lands.

The video should showcase pizza making, dough stretching, or wood-fired oven scenes (placeholder video for now).

Overlay a bold heading:
“Welcome to Donatello – Artisan Pizza, Born in Fire”
with a call-to-action button: “See Our Pizzas”.

Pizzas Section:

Create sections for:

Detroit Style Pizza

New York Style Pizza

Each section should include:

Image placeholders

Descriptions

Optional ingredient highlights with subtle animations (like hovering toppings/icons)

Color Palette:

Use a warm color scheme:

Cheese Gold (#FFD95A or similar)

Tomato Red (#E63946 or similar)

Garlic Cream/White (#FAF3E0 or similar)

Use natural textures subtly (like wood grain, parchment backgrounds).

Micro Animations:

Animate buttons, scroll effects, pizza images on hover, and transitions between sections.

Use smooth scrolling and a gentle parallax effect where appropriate.

Navigation:

Sticky nav bar with links to: Home, Menu, Order, About Us, Contact.

On scroll, the nav bar slightly shrinks or changes background color for readability.

Mobile-First & Responsive:

Must look excellent on smartphones and tablets.

Mobile menu with hamburger icon.

Footer:

Include social media icons

Address and opening hours

“Crafted with ❤️ by Donatello”

Bonus (optional but desirable):

Allow adding reviews/testimonials

Contact form with map

Add favicon

Tech Stack Suggestions:
Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if using a framework).

Add GSAP or Lottie for micro animations (optional).

Style using TailwindCSS or clean custom CSS.
